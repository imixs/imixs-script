# Imixs-Script

Imixs-Script is a JavaScript library to build powerful web based workflow applications.
Imixs-Script is based on JQuery and can be used together with common SPA-Frameworks like [Angular](https://www.angularjs.org/), [BenJS](http://www.benjs.org), [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/) or your own framework. 
Imixs-Script handles all the communication with the Imixs-Workflow engine via the Imixs Rest API which makes it easy to build a flexible ans scalable business application.
